# NBCustomTransition for iOS #

NBCustomTransition is an experiment I made to play with the [Hero](https://github.com/lkzhao/Hero) library, which allows you to create view controller transition easily.

I used the design of an app I'm currently working on to create a transition between two view controllers.
